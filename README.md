# Linux-File-Librarian
This project provides a set of tools for sysadmins to deduplicate, organize, and search large collections of files on a Linux system. It intelligently merges file libraries, prioritizes higher-quality files (like OCR'd PDFs), and provides a simple GUI for searching the final, clean library.
