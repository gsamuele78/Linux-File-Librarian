#
# This is the central configuration file for the entire project.
# Edit the values below to match your system setup.
# Do NOT use quotes around the paths.

[Paths]
# A comma-separated list of the FULL paths to your source libraries.
# This handles both use cases:
#   1. A single folder to be organized:
#      source_paths = /mnt/data/downloads
#   2. Multiple folders to be merged into one library:
#      source_paths = /mnt/archive/dnd, /home/jfs/documents/rpgs, /media/external/old_collection
source_paths = /path/to/your/library

# The FULL path where the new, organized library will be created.
# The script will create this directory if it doesn't exist.
library_root = /path/to/your/new_unified_library

[Settings]
# The minimum acceptable size for a PDF in bytes.
# This is used as part of the "quality score" during deduplication. A larger,
# non-empty PDF is generally preferred over a zero-byte or tiny one.
# Default is 10 KB (10 * 1024 = 10240).
min_pdf_size_bytes = 10240

[KnowledgeBaseURLs]
# This section defines the URLs to be scraped by the knowledge base builder.
# The key before the '=' (e.g., tsr_archive) MUST match a parser key in the
# PARSER_MAPPING dictionary within 'src/build_knowledgebase.py'.
#
# You can comment out any line with a '#' to skip scraping that site.
